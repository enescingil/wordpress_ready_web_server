# wordpress_ready_web_server
Bash script for automatically setting up a web server who can run wordpress on it. Please do not forget to look to the files individually and change them to your requirements. After the installation you still have to manually add an user(if you wanted to) and setup the wordpress site, create nginx, php-fpm vhost config files, create site db and db user.
